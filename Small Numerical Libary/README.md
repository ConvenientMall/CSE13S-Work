##INSTRUCTIONS

To build: go to the directory with mathlib.c and mathlib-test.c file and type "make" and press enter

To run: go to the directory with "mathlib-test" and type "./mathlib-test" and one or more of the command line arguments.

-a: to run all tests  
-s: to run arcsin tests  
-c: to run arccos tests  
-t: to run arctan tests  
-l: to run log tests
